instead of putting my thoughts on this game in the readme, I'll put them in here to keep things clean

NOTE: everything in this log is just thoughts and possibilities, nothing concrete

what side of the drawabox 50/50 rule would I count the cat's tale art towards?

eh, doesnt matter, just need to remember I don't need to wait till I'm good to do things, I'll get good by doing things

but, to be honest, my "concept art" is painfully ass right now

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -

I need to make more art for this, it's great practice for both digital art & video game development

My problem right now is the fact that I can't think of anything interesting to draw, so the few images I have so far feel simple and bland

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -

Made a basic mockup of a sewer section, I want to flush that out some more, maybe make a few sections after

I think after the sewer I'll move on to the forest

Yesterday I made some terrible looking concept art for the initial storm drain. It may have looked bad, but it wasn't that bad.
Mainly it was just a bare bones skeleton outline of the space with some notes on it, and it felt good do get out there.

Later at home for my next daily krita drawing i'll try making something else cat's tale related

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I made a little pixel guy yesterday, not a Cat, but since I first started this I can't seem to get a clear image of my protagonist in my head

Tablet should arrive today, I can't wait, I know I could draw now, but I feel like this will really help alot. Today for my Krita drawing I'll try to do something related to Cat's Tail

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/13/25

Currently working my way through the Unity tutorials for 2d games, not sure if they have a 2.5D game tutorial, but if not I'll just move up to the 3D game tutorial

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/12/25

Tonight I plan on pulling out my sketch pad, I'll try to draw some things on topic/in game

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/11/25

I ordered a drawing tablet off amazon that should be here by Sunday, I'm also gonna start drawing a little everyday in Krita, so far I suck really bad, but I'll get better

This may not be totally Cat's tale related, but it is in the interest of digital art in general, which is for games I hope to make someday, so I'll give this a pass for now

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/10/25

I havent accomplished anything on this, but it's almost the weekend, I'll try to get something cobbled together over the next few days

Worst case scenario I'll look through some asset packs

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/09/25

I need to figure out the art for this game, I don't have any real digital art skills, but maybe I'll think of something if I look up asset packs related to the art style I want

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/08/25

Re-animal was good, I love the environment, I need to see if there are any "making of" videos by the developers for either this game or one of the other similar games they've made

While playing I kept imagining using a similar animation style and color palate for Cat's Tale

I didn't make a dumb version this weekend like I wanted to, but it's not the end of the world. It's the holidays and my birthday, plus I can just do it later this week or this coming weekend

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/07/25

I downloaded the demo for Re-animal, gonna play a little to see what it's like

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/06/25

If I want to make a Cat's tail lite, I think itll just be a puzzle explorer

Keep it as simple as possible, a Cat sprite in the sewers

Eventually work my way up to some sort of maze, and maybe environmental interactions if I can figure it out, but to start it'll just be a character sprite inside a space that resembles a pipe, and you can run left or right & jump

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/05/25

I need to look up kitten sprites for a Night Run Studio Clone I want to make this weekend 

it may not be the game I want to eventually make, but Itll still be in the general theme to keep my mind on track

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/04/25

I need to play:
        - Little nightmares 1 & 2
        - Limbo
        - Little Misfortune
        - Inside
        - Re-Animal

note: I need to get some posters for the games that inspire me


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ending I have in mind might seem like a dick move, but I feel like it hits just right

the main character has to complete some kind of puzzle to get out of the gas chamber, I'm thinking you use something you found to break the pipe and then make a spark to blow a hole in the wall

You then jump out of the hole and run down the hill where you find a boat is tied, jump on the boat and remove the rope so it begans to drift out to sea
When the next scene loads, everything is bright and warm and the boat carrying the kitten beaches itself on a small island.

When the kitten jumps out to explore it finds all of its siblings and eventually its mother

At first everything seems happy and perfect but the kitten doesn't understand how this is possible and keeps asking its mother what happened

eventually the mother gets sad and apologizes to the kitten, explaining that because he looked too closely they all have to go away now

The scene shifts and the kitten is shown to still be in the gas chamber before everything fades away leaving the kitten curled up in a void of darkness

He sits there curled up for a few moments wondering where everyone is at? Why is it so dark? so cold? he's so alone, where is he supposed to go?

and then he just stops

the kitten fades away, leaving a black screen

the game ends

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/02/25

Main character: the kitten

Friendly NPC's:     Mom
                    Siblings
                    certain critters?

Enemy NPC's:        Rats
                    wild animals
                    Psycho children
                    Men in white (animal catchers)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12/01/25

The main character won't have any lines, the only dialogue in the whole game will be the mother, father, and maybe overhearing a human (but nothing for sure)

The story will be entirely told through the environment and will be intuited by the player

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/30/25

First step first

Create a blank background, add a floor, and a basic sprite (probably a oblong spherical pin)

I can add movement & controls next, but for now I just need to be as basic as possible

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/29/25

I'm playing around with the Idea of making a simple version first, something along the lines of the night run studio tutorials

My only issue is with the name, I really like Cat's tale and would want to use that with the later version

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/28/25

I think little nightmares is a 2.5D game, whatever it is that is what I want for Cat's Tale

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/27/25

Types of puzzles: 
  environmental - moving objects, actionable items (switches, knobs), breaking objects
  story - retrieving objects, collecting items, offering items or help

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11/25/25

I've been thinking about what this game needs to be, By far the most important factor will be the environment, both visual and auditory.
I have an Idea of how I want it to look and the feelings I want to create in people, but I'm at a loss for the sounds. I need to start listening to open source music/effects on gameDev sites.
See if there is anyone out there who feels like a good match.

I also need to start planning out gameplay, This may be a heavily story driven game but there needs to be at least a little bit of a challenge, some puzzles and sneeaking portions, but I still have tons of time.

I need to play more games that have a similar style to what I'm trying to make, for research

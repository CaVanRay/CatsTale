instead of putting my thoughts on this game in the readme, I'll put them in here to keep things clean

I've been thinking about what this game needs to be, By far the most important factor will be the environmet, both visual and auditory.
I have an Idea of how I want it to look and the feelings I want to create in people, but I'm at a loss for the sounds. I need to start listening to open source music/effects on gameDev sites.
See if there is anyone out there who feels like a good match.

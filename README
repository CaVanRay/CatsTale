I need to copy my notebook notes to this file before I lose it


Follows a kitten from birth to death over the course of a depressing hopless life

After your mother dies and your siblings get washed away, you go on a journy to find the others, but everytime you find another sibling they are already dead (except the last, who you arrive just in time to see them kill themselves)

Order of story:

- Birth
- Family
- Tragedy - Flood
- Loss - Mom
- Gutter - Either Drowned or Eaten by rats
- Alleys
- Dingy kitchen? - Killed by Cook
- Park - Killed by horrible kids
- Forest - Killed by wild animals
- Field - Frozen to death - Definitely this one
- Road - Hit by car - maybe, not really a fan
- Ocean cliff - Suicide - Definitely this one
- City
- Rooftop
- Reunion - Find Dad
- Betrayal - Tossed to animal control by Dad to take his place
- Caught
- Pound
- Gas Chamber
- Escape
- Reveal - You didnt actually escape, you died

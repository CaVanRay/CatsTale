I need to copy my notebook notes to this file before I lose it


Follows a kitten from birth to death over the course of a depressing hopless life

After your mother dies and your siblings get washed away, you go on a journy to find the others, but everytime you find another sibling they are already dead (except the last, who you arrive just in time to see them kill themselves)

Order of story:

- Birth - in a rain gutter with your mother and siblings, she will note that you "look just like your father"
- Family
- Tragedy - heavy rainstorm leads to a sudden flood that washes away your siblings, your mother is able to push you up through a grate at the last minute before you drown
- Loss - after the storm passes and the water recedes, you find your mothers dead body
- Gutter - Either Drowned or Eaten by rats - First sibling you find, It should introduce you to what kind of game this is
- Alleys
- Dingy kitchen? - Killed by Cook - Forgot about this one, but I guess it works
- Park - Killed by horrible kids - I like this one, but not tied to it
- Forest - Killed by wild animals
- Field - Frozen to death - Definitely this one
- Road - Hit by car - maybe, not really a fan
- Ocean cliff - Suicide - Definitely this one
- City
- Rooftop
- Reunion - Find Dad
- Betrayal - Tossed to animal control by Dad to take his place
- Caught
- Pound
- Gas Chamber
- Escape
- Reveal - You didnt actually escape, you died

In total there will be 6 acts, first 5 end with a dead sibling, the last one ends with your death.

  - Mother dies
  - discover each sibling dead
  -re-unite with father
  - he sacrifices you to save himself

# Narrative Overview #

This game follows the life of a kitten from birth to death across a bleak, hopeless journey defined by loss, environmental indifference, and emotional decay. After its mother dies and its siblings are swept away in a storm, the kitten begins a desperate search to find them. Each discovery reveals another sibling already dead—except for the final one, whose suicide the kitten witnesses moments too late.
The story is structured into six acts. The first five conclude with the death of a sibling; the final act ends with the death of the main character. Themes include abandonment, the fragility of innocence, and the quiet cruelty of a world that does not care.

## The Search Begins ##

The kitten enters the wider world, beginning a sequence of areas in which each sibling is found dead. These deaths define the tone, reinforce hopelessness, and anchor each act.
### Siblings Deaths (Possible Sequence Order): ###
1. **Gutter** - Sibling drowned or eaten by rats. _Tone-setting introduction to the harsh world._
2. **Dingy Kitchen** - Sibling killed by a cook. _Accidental, mondane brutality._
3. **Park** - Sibling killed by cruel children. _Human indifference or intentional cruelty._
4. **Forest** - Sibling killed by wild animals. _Nature offers no mercy._
5. **Field** - Sibling frozen to death. _Slow, quiet, inevitable._
6. **Road (Optional)** - Sibling hit by a car. _Possible but not preferred._
7. **Ocean Cliff** Sibling commits suicide. _The only sibling the kitten reaches in time to witness the death._

**Goal:** Build emotional degradation through repeated loss. Each area reinforces the theme that the world is uncaring, not evil.

## The City & Reunion ##

**Setting:## Urban outskirts -> rooftops -> inner city
* The kitten navigates through the city in the final attempt to find family.
* The kitten discovers its father alive.
* The father plays along a bit and then betrays the main character, pushing him off the roof to fall into the clutches of animal control in the fathers place. _you look very similar, animal control officers assume you are the one they've been hunting_

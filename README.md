#Narrative Overview

This game follows the life of a kitten from birth to death across a bleak, hopeless journey defined by loss, environmental indifference, and emotional decay. After its mother dies and its siblings are swept away in a storm, the kitten begins a desperate search to find them. Each discovery reveals another sibling already dead—except for the final one, whose suicide the kitten witnesses moments too late.
The story is structured into six acts. The first five conclude with the death of a sibling; the final act ends with the death of the main character. Themes include abandonment, the fragility of innocence, and the quiet cruelty of a world that does not care.
